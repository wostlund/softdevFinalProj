###The Idea
We will create a Secret Santa gift giving platform that is better than Elfster. This tool will facilitate Secret Santa gift exchanges and make it really fun and cool.

###Cool Features
* You can search for Etsy items, and add them to/remove them from your wishlist or shopping list!
* You can create a blacklist of people you donâ€™t want to be matched with!
* You can create multiple groups to do gift exchanges with, and Ctrl.Alt.Gift shuffles the members for you!

###Instructions
* Clone and add keys.txt to the main directory.
* Run app.py.
* Enjoy!

###Important notes:
* When creating a group, invite members by typing their usernames into the textarea, separated by line breaks.
* Groups will not be created if no valid configuration of members and blacklists exist.
